        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi!! I'm Pradakshina, currently studying BSc AI at VU Amsterdam with a strong focus on using technology to tackle climate change, sustainability, and wildlife conservation. I'm a firm believer that AI can play a key role in solving some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges. I'm passionate about finding innovative ways to apply AI to support sustainable practices and protect our planet's biodiversity.

            When I'm not diving into AI projects, you'll likely find me playing guitar, which is something I've loved for years. It's my creative outlet and keeps me inspired, whether I'm solving problems or just enjoying the music. I'm driven by the idea that technology, when used responsibly, can help create a better world for both people and nature.
